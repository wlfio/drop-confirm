# DropConfirm

Think twice before you drop.

## Compatibility

At this time, DropConfirm is only tested on 1.20.1 and *should* work on 1.20.

Newer versions will likely be supported, and older versions may or may not work with slight modifications to the source.

## Roadmap

- [x] Add configurations
- [x] Add a command/keybind to toggle the plugin
- [ ] Detect if the player is in a dangerous area (e.g. lava, void, etc.)
- [ ] Add translations

## Configuration

- Reset Delay:
  - Amount of time (in seconds) before the confirmation status is reset.
