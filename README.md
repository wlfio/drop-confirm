## What even *is* DropConfirm?

DropConfirm is a **configurable quality-of-life mod** that adds a confirmation dialog when dropping items. I made it
because I was tired of accidentally dropping my items to other players or into lava/voids.

I use this mod personally, and I wanted to share it with others because I've noticed that a lot of my friends have had
this exact problem (and I assume others have too).

## Compatibility

As of now, DropConfirm is only tested on 1.20.1 â€“ but it *should* work on 1.20 too.

Newer versions will likely be supported, and older versions may or may not work with slight modifications to the source.

## Roadmap

- [x] Add configurations
- [x] Add a command/keybind to toggle the mod
- [x] Add sound events for toggling the mod and dropping items
- [ ] Detect if the player is in a dangerous area (e.g. lava, void, etc.)
- [ ] Add translations

## Configuration

- **Enable:**
  - Whether or not to enable DropConfirm.
- **Play Sounds:**
  - Whether or not to play sounds when doing various actions related to DropConfirm, e.g.:
    - Enabling/Disabling
    - Dropping items
- **Reset Delay:**
  - Amount of time (in seconds) before the confirmation status is reset.
